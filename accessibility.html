        <h2>Accessibility Solutions On My Website</h2>

        <div>
            <h3>Colour Blindness</h3>
            <p>Research shows that 99% of colour blind people have red-green colour blindness. This means they have difficulty distinguishing between these two colours. To accommodate for this, on my quiz page, I opted for using blue to indicate an incorrect answer and green for a correct answer. For more information on colourblindness, follow this link: <a href="https://www.colorblindguide.com/post/red-green-color-blindness">Colourblind Guide</a>.</p>

            <h3>Use of Smaller Screens</h3>
            <p>The website is compatable at a minimum width of 320px, meaning that it will run on the users smartphones.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Physical Disabilities</h3>
            <p>There is no time limit on the quiz, or any other page on the website. The page can also be fully navigated using the keyboard.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Speech Disabilities</h3>
            <p>The user has a choice of how they contact me. They can copy my email and send me an email in a format they are comfortable with, or they can fill out the form and press submit.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Blindness</h3>
            <p>The photos in the quiz have been explained in the alt section of the img tag. This along with a speech reader would allow a blind person to take the quiz, and understand other photos used throughout the website.</p>
