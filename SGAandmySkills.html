            <h2>Sheffield Graduate Attributes (SGA)</h2>
            <p>The University of Sheffield aims to provide its graduates with desirable traits that will benefit them in their future life. The three main focuses are academic success, personal development and employability. It is believed that everyone posseses their own unique set of skills and that these skills should be considered by students when choosing their personal development goals. SGA is split into three main categories which are 'My Learning', 'My impact', and 'My self'.</p>
            <p>My Learning is a section that recognises the importance in the enjoyment factor when studying a subject. It discusses skills that facilitate learning and application of knowledge. <br>My Impact focuses on teamwork skills and ultimately the positive impact you would have when collaborating with others.<br>My Self introduces the ideas of how your wellbeing hugely impacts and underpins other attributes. It highlights how tasks such as defining purpose will show great benefits, including in the development of attributes.</p>

            <h2>mySkills</h2>
            <p>The aim of this is to determine the skills of any individual that takes part by completing the questionaire. You can then actively choose which skills you want to improve on. Once all this is done, you can keep going back and adding your experiences, with the aim being that in the future it will be a useful record of events in your personal development. This record can be very helpful when writing a CV, or for when you come to applying for placements, internships and jobs. </p>

            <h2>Personal SGA Examples</h2>
            <p>I have taken up football for the Universities' 5th team. The social interaction and physical exercise involved in this goes a long way to ensuring my mental and physical wellbeing.</p>
            <p>My degree has a large focus on working in teams, since that is a key skill in the work of a software engineer. I am currently working in 2 separate teams for 2 separate assignments. I have already found my ability to work with others has been improving and will continue to do so, which is very important since this is a pivotal skill if I am to be successful in my career.</p>
            <p>The 'My Learning' aspect of SGA has been covered by my modules in a number of ways. For example, frequent timed examinations improve my critical thinking, and also difficult assignments result in my research skills improving as I am required to further educate myself in order to complete the tasks. </p>
