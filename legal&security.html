                <h2>Legal Issues Addressed</h2>
                <p>All images used in this website have either been taken or created by me, or taken off the google images with the filter "Creative Commons licenses" applied. This means I have permission to use all the images I have used on my website.</p>
                <p>I have included a statement about GDPR in the "Contact Me" section, under the input field for the user's email address. I have also ensured the data collection is minimal by only collecting the necessary data. Their email address is not a required field, so they will not feel a need to input it. I have also included my GDPR statement directly underneath to ensure they see it and are made aware of how their data will be used at the time that they input it.</p>

                <h2>Security Issues</h2>
                <p>My website does not run any scripts, user entry is not processed in any way and the user data is not stored. Therefore any issues with security have been avoided.</p>
